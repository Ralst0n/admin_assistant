A quick link to our common administrative task in the office

In our office, a task like creating a standard New Hire, Status Change form for an employee involves creating a new folder for that employee in the employees directory then creating each of the necessary subfolders in that folder, searching the templates folder for a blank status change form, copying it pasting it in the proper subfolder,
renaming it based on the type of status change before being able to fill out the form itself. The tediousness of this and other similarly common tasks
motivated me to create a console app that lets me accomplish these items more quickly.

The Admin assistant asks questions it needs to quickly search or create the items you need to start your tasks.

Getting to the point where you can fill out a status change form goes from minutes of searching, copying and pasting repeatedly to answering a few prompts and the programming filling in as many of 
the tedious blanks for you as it can.

The assistant created the employee's missing folders, then added the new hire status change form to the employee directory and opened it.
